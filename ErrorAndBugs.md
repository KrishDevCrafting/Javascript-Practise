# ErrorAndBugs

In JavaScript and some other programming languages, we say that an error is thrown. An error can be defined as a faulty piece of code that prevents the program from further execution, an error gets thrown and the program stops.

the most common are syntax error, type error, and reference error. You have just learned about reference error.

Syntax error: A syntax error occurs when you write a piece of code that JavaScript cannot read. For example, if you declare a variable and assign it a value of a string, but forget one of the closing quotation symbols. Alternatively, suppose you try to run an array method on a number.
