(what is this)
The Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) refers to the greatest number that is a common divisor for a given set of numbers. It is also termed as the Highest Common Factor (HCF) or the Greatest Common Factor (GCF).



Example: Find the greatest common divisor of 13 and 48.
Solution: We will use the following steps to find the greatest common divisor of (13, 48).

Divisors of 13 = 1, and 13.
Divisors of 48 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24 and 48.

The common divisor of 13 and 48 is 1.
The greatest common divisor of 13 and 48 is 1.

Therefore, GCD(13, 48) = 1
